# Android Studio Senior Semester - Project 1

This was our first project for our senior class where we studied Android Studio projects.

The goal of the project was to explore creating a simple interface and a supporting function for an app to accomplish something. The application takes a number, its base, and a new base we wish to convert it to and performs said conversion, then displays it for the user to see. All code was written by me from a boilerplate Android project using Android Studio.
